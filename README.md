I've been a computer science engineer for more than 10 years now, I've discovered Ansible in 2014, and fell in love with it. I use it in my company to manage different server since then. Feel free to visit our site www.neovia.fr

I'm also one of the founder of Immozeo, where Ansible is also greatly used. ( www.immozeo.com )
